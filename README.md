## MEAL - ordering application

## Basic Overview - [Live Demo](https://menu-cart-order.netlify.app/)

I present to you my ordering application where customers select food then proceed to checkout and see the receipt instantly with complete details of the order.

My inspiration for this is a Japanese restaurant I visited months ago, In the restaurant, the customer order on the iPad (IPad already prepare on the table) then start ordering and that it.

The experience was simple and efficient no need for interaction with the waiter, so I decided to build this application to implement what I had experienced and to improve my skills on react.js and ecosystem, and Iâ€™m proud of it.
